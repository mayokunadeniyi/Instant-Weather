# Instant Weather :partly_sunny:

![Android Build](https://github.com/mayokunthefirst/Instant-Weather/workflows/Android%20Build/badge.svg) ![Android Weekly](https://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-413/badge) [![BCH compliance](https://bettercodehub.com/edge/badge/mayokunthefirst/Instant-Weather?branch=master)](https://bettercodehub.com/) ![My twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/url?style=social&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fmayokunadeniyi) ![Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen)

An Android weather application implemented using the MVVM pattern, Retrofit2, LiveData, ViewModel, Coroutines, Room, Navigation Components, Data Binding and some other libraries from the [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) . Instant Weather fetches data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to provide real time weather information. It also makes use of the [Algolia Instant Search](https://www.algolia.com/products/instantsearch/) service which enables you search for weather conditions of various locations.

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
* A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to manage fragment operations.
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)(MVVM) which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.

## Technologies used:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Dagger2](https://dagger.dev/) for dependency injection.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to handle all navigations and also passing of data between destinations.
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* [Algolia Search API - Android](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/getting-started/android/) to quickly and seamlessly implement search within the application.
* [Work Manager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) to manage Android background jobs.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) to declaratively bind UI components in layouts to data sources.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
* [Preferences](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/settings) to create interactive settings screens.

## Installation
Instant Weather requires a minimum API level of 21. Clone the repository. You will need an API key from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) to request data. If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key. Also, you will need an API key, APP ID and an [Index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/faq/basics/what-is-an-index/) from [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) to be able to implement the search functionality in the application.
In your project's root directory, create a file `apikey.properties` and include the following lines:

````
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
ALGOLIA_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
ALGOLIA_APP_ID = "YOUR_APP_ID"
````
