[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f34e66ed388d400e919a60a2bbae38f0)](https://app.codacy.com/manual/mayokunthefirst/Instant-Weather?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=mayokunthefirst/Instant-Weather&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Dashboard)

## Introduction
An Android weather application implemented using MVVM pattern, Retrofit2, LiveData, ViewModel, Coroutines, Room, Navigation Components and Data Binding.

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
* A single-activity architecture, using the [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to manage fragment operations.
* Pattern [Model-View-ViewModel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)(MVVM) which facilitates a separation of development of the graphical user interface.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.

## Technologies used:

* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) to handle data in a lifecycle-aware fashion.
* [Navigation Component](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation) to handle all navigations and also passing of data between destinations.
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) to declaratively bind UI components in layouts to data sources.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

## Installation
Instant weather requires a minimum API level of 21. Clone the repository. You will need an API key from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) to request data. If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key. 
In your project's root directory, create a file `apikey.properties` and include the following lines:

````
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"
````

Build and run the project.
